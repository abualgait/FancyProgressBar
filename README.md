# FancyProgressBar 💫
FancyProgressBar is a custom progress bar component developed using Jetpack Compose. It offers a visually appealing way to display progress with various customization options.

## Showcase 🎨

**Compose ConstraintLayout** 🖼️
FancyProgressBar leverages ConstraintLayout in Jetpack Compose to manage the layout of its components. This ensures flexibility and responsiveness in adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.

**Animation in Compose** 🚀
The progress animation in FancyProgressBar is implemented using Jetpack Compose's animation APIs. This provides smooth and fluid transitions, enhancing the user experience while the progress updates.

**PointerInput** 👆
FancyProgressBar supports PointerInput, allowing users to interact with the progress bar directly. This enables intuitive control, such as dragging the progress indicator to a specific point.
